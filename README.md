this repo contains files to train recurrent model on human chromosome 1 data. 

Overview
DNALSTM is a deep learning project focused on analyzing DNA sequences to predict specific features, such as the count of 'CG' dinucleotides, using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. This project aims to leverage the sequential nature of DNA to provide insights into its structure and function, with potential applications in genomics and bioinformatics.

Features
DNA Sequence Processing: Converts raw DNA sequences into numerical data suitable for deep learning models.
CG Dinucleotide Prediction: Predicts the count of 'CG' dinucleotides in given DNA sequences, which is crucial for understanding DNA methylation patterns.
LSTM Model: Utilizes an LSTM model for capturing the long-term dependencies in DNA sequences.
Embedding Layer: Transforms nucleotide characters into dense vectors to capture more complex relationships.
